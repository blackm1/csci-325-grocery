Please decide how to communicate (team member can edit this file.)

Some Suggestions:

Twitter: Setup a twitter account that any team member can post to.  This allows everyone to communicate at their leisure and provide a full history of what has been said.

IM/Hangouts/IRC: Share everyone's hangout/IM/IRC account so people can communicate in real time.

email: share everyone's email account to send message back and forth.

You may setup of physical meetings, but keep in mind that the online use will need to have a virtual presence!

Team choice (edit below this line):

Hey, this is Matthew. I don't care how we communicate. Text, email, IM, or whatever works for me. What about you guys?

Eric Comitz here. I can be reached via etcomitz@csustudent.net. If you need to contact me immediately, I can be called at 571-429-3861

My email is MCMcCrackin@csustudent.net    - Matthew

Martin here.   I can be reached at 8437542203.   I was thinking we could use an IM app or something if we're all up for it.

That sounds good to me - Matthew

Does everyone have Facebook, perhaps? We can also IM there. We can make a group conversation, ancd it'll be handy. -- Eric

Yeah, that'd work for me - Matthew
